Hello
Here I will try ti predict the natural disasters by using some sensors and proper % ratios that are scientifically proven by the geologist
We can use sime tactics that are in a inventory basis can help to predict the natural flood that lead.


Development programs to decrease disaster vulnerability should be incorporated 
into every level of project preparation. Local people should be involved in integration 
measures as they are aware of the remedies available in the neighbourhood. There is a 
wide range of options for incorporating mitigation measures into regular development 
programs. 
Strengthening of urban utility systems and industrial support infrastructure is a 
common aim of development projects. This can be achieved through a variety of inputs, 
including loans, technical assistance, and institution development support. Utility 
Systems like water, electric power, transport links and communications must be made 
more effective as well as more selectively resistant to particular hazards.
Investments in transport and communications also improve our ability to 
respond to, and recover from, a major disaster. For example, improvements in 
conditions of road will usually make evacuation and relief easier. Better 
communications will often lead to improved early warning and more effective 
preparedness and response measures. Investments in airports and bridges can help speed 
up the delivery of relief resources.

Modernization of the weather prediction system. New observation and information technologies can improve the prediction of severe weather, floods, wildfire potential, and other weather-related hazards
Research to improve the prediction of atmospheric and hydrologic hazards. Research is needed to increase understanding of the physical processes associated with the generation of severe storms and to develop advanced numerical models to predict their characteristics
Expanded earthquake monitoring and research. Reliable predictions and seismic zonation would permit individuals and communities to take actions 

New technologies for dissemination of warnings. The ideal warning system would ensure that all potential victims are alerted to an incipient disaster as quickly as possible
Hence in this way numerous ways are present to predict the disaster .
